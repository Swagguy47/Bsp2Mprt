# Bsp2Mprt
 Generate Mprt files for placing props outside of Legion with the greater compatibility of snake-biscuits' bsp_tool

*Fully compatible with [ApexMapImporter]([url](https://github.com/llennoco22/Apex-mprt-importer-for-Blender)) and [Titanfall-Unity-Tools]([url](https://github.com/Swagguy47/VRChat-Titanfall-Unity-Tools)) MPRT parsers*

Utilizes: https://github.com/snake-biscuits/bsp_tool for BSP parsing, should have good compatibility with Titanfall 1, Online, 2, among others

### Nerd stuff below:

Compiles with pyinstaller (`pip install -U pyinstaller`)

Virtually no difference in output between Legion+ and Bsp2Mprt
